# Lets-Do-It-Dude

A to do app project for The Odin Project

This was an attempt at making a todo list for the odin project

As you can see in the commits I have gone through various ways of constructing this.

At this point I think that the way I have things setup is overly complicated and hard to follow.

I will be closing out this project for now and working on a new project utilzing datasets to track the lists and to do elements.
